# line_ratio_reliability
Repository containing scripts for the analysis of the reliability of line ratios in a clumpy high-redshift Universe

To use the notebooks you would need a working installation of [synthesizer](https://synthesizer-project.github.io/synthesizer/).

The data (SPS grid, FLARES data, observational data (the public ones)) required for the analysis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dmsp7VNr3qeMwq5jnnAupgcJaekyK8ZD?usp=sharing).

If you run the whole notebooks once it should produce the same toy galaxy properties that you see in the paper due to the choice of the random number seed.
