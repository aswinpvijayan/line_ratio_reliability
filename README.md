# Interpreting nebular line ratios in the high-redshift Universe
Repository containing scripts for the analysis of the interpretability of line ratios in a clumpy high-redshift Universe used in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20190).

To use the notebooks you would need a working installation of [synthesizer](https://synthesizer-project.github.io/synthesizer/).

The data (SPS grid, FLARES data, observational data (the public ones)) required for the analysis can be found [here]([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dmsp7VNr3qeMwq5jnnAupgcJaekyK8ZD?usp=sharing](https://sussex.box.com/s/86fw5t5l51fz6fbno95sigzsyv964k2n)) (We have not made the data from Rowland+2025 public, since the paper is not published. Please comment out those lines when running the notebook).
